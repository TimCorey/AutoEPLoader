AutoEPLoader
============

Creates a sqlplan file from a ShowPlanXML string and then displays it in the SQL Execution Plan viewer. This is to make up for a shortcoming in SQL Management Studio 2005 that does not allow you to see the visual version of the execution plan unless you first save the XML as a file.
